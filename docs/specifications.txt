snapaway specifications

This is the documentation for snapaway's specifications.  That is, details about
the hardware and software used to make the project, and details about what it is
capable of.

This is part of a set of documentation in github.com/joseph-reynolds/snapaway:
 - docs for devlopers -- how the software works
 - docs for camera administrators -- how to configure a camera system
 - docs for camera end users -- how to control the camera and look at pictures

See also the README file.


Scope of this project:
Here are some of the parameters of this project:
 - The project is based specifically on the Raspberry Pi (RPI).
   As written, this project uses the RPI Zero W.
   If you perfer, you can "easily" use a different RPI, if it has WiFi.
 - The project is based specificaly on the Raspberry Pi Camera (RaspiCam).
   I used version V2.  The software uses motion data specifically from the
   RaspiCam, and USB web cameras cannot be used.
 - The current draw is less than 500 milliamps at 5V.  I tried this with an old
   700mA phone charger, and it works okay.

 - low cost, like $50 USD per camera (see details below)
 - still pictures are good enough, video is not needed
 - can access surveillance photos from a few days back
   (would like 9 days)
 - can access photos from an iPad or iPhone
   and it is okay if we can access only when we are at home
 - cameras are connected to my home WiFi.  Currently: This is
   for the NTP servers and ease of development.  I would like to 
   remove this requirement, say by adding a Real Time Clock (RTC).
 - security:
   + password protection
   + transport layer security (SSL)
   + (eventually) photos should be encrypted on disk so that can only
     be viewed by authorized users
 - no fixed upper limit on number of cameras
 - each camera has access to 120V power (alternate: 5V power, at least 500mA, should be 700mA)
 - cameras are housed indoors (controlled temperature and humidity)
 - would like battery backup in case of power failure
 - would like to avoid requirement for home WiFi connection
   (but need real-time clock, etc)
 - would like to tie into other sensors:
    + motion detectors (PIR)
    + door open switches
 - would like to add multiple cameras (another camera) to each RPI.


Project materials:
I used 4 cameras.  You only really need one.
I used the USB OTG, USB hub, keyboard, HDMI to help debug up the system.
You may not need these items.

The material cost includes:
 - 4 sets of Raspberry Pi computers, each with:
   + Raspberry Pi Zero W
   + Raspberry Pi Camera (with case and connector)
   + 16Gb SanDisk card (micro), although 8Gb is minimum
   + 2.1A power supply (USB micro), although 700mA should be considered minimum
 - USB powered hub with USB OTG
 - USB keyboard
 - Adapter: USB A to micro B
 - Adapter: HDMI to HDMI mini
 - I am also using a HDMI monitor, not included in the costs
 - I am currently using a Windows workstation to coordinate everything,
   not included in the cost.
