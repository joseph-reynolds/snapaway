snapaway customer docs

This is the documentation for snapaway customers.  That is, details about
how to use your new camera system.
If you got this, you are an ALPHA tester, which means the product is not yet
ready for market and you should expect to find problems.
Please

This is part of a set of documentation in github.com/joseph-reynolds/snapaway:
 - docs for devlopers -- how the software works
 - docs for camera administrators -- how to configure a camera system
 - docs for camera end users -- how to control the camera and look at pictures

See also the README file.
____________________________

Your camera administrator should have set up camera devices you requested
and given you their names.

To view the photos, use a device on the same network as your camera devices.

Troubleshooting
 - No photos?  Try waving your hand in front of the lens.
 - Cannot connect to the browser? Check if your camera device is turned on.
   You should see a green light inside the case.
 - Cannot connect your browser?  You must use a device on the same network
   as your camera devices.
   For example, a laptop or iPad.  An iPhone may not work because it may be connected
   via the cell tower.
