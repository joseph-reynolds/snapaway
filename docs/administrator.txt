snapaway docs for camera administrators

This is the documentation for snapaway administrators.  That is, folks who want
to set up the cameras.

This is part of a set of documentation in github.com/joseph-reynolds/snapaway:
 - docs for devlopers -- how the software works
 - docs for camera administrators -- how to configure a camera system
 - docs for camera end users -- how to control the camera and look at pictures

See also the README file.

_______________

The basic producedure is:
 - get the parts (see the specs in docs/specification.txt)
 - assemble each camera device
 - put Raspbian linux on the SSD card
 - configure each RPI:
    + each one should have an unique name, e.g., raspi0, raspi1, raspi2, etc
    + configure the locale and timezone
    + change the password for user pi.  All password must be the same.
    + configure ssh
    + stop the camera with command: shutdown now
 - deploy the camera to its spot and plug it in
 - use the snapaway-admin tool to update the camera's software and
   deploy snapaway software.  This should start the camera and its website running. 
   Debug via ssh: sudo systemctl status snapaway-cam
 - Check for images on the camera's web site.
   If any require rotation, modify snapaway-cam.py and redeploy.
 - Turn over the system to the customer.  Show them how the website works, and 
   what the camera names are.
