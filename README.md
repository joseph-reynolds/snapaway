Security photos from Raspberry Pi Camera

Purpose of this project:
1. The primary purpose of this project is to showcase my software engineering skills,
   not to provide a full-featured product, so I may choose to provide multiple ways
   of doing things (like web applications using multiple technologies) and not develop
   features within the product that do not further this goal.
   In particular, I am getting up to speed on modern web technology, REST APIs, etc.
2. Provide security photos to find out what my kids were doing at 2am.
   The main idea is that cameras pointed at my doors and windows capture activity
   which I can review the next day.

See more refined documentation in the "docs" directory.

Here is a list of the technology used in the project:
 - Windows 7 running Python 3.4 and putty
 - Raspberry Pi single board computer assembly and configuraton
 - Linux (Raspbian, a branch of Debian)
 - Secure Shell (ssh)
 - Python (2.7) programing, installation, and multiple libraries
 - systemctl daemon to auto-start system services
 - Camera technology, capture frames from videos, motion detection
 - Controlling multiple cameras from a single point
 - GitHub, including use of Git Issues
 - Documentation
 - Python Flask to create a simple web site
